A simple score tracker created with Javascript

This was created as an assignment from a Udemy course, the premise was to create a score tracker for a game of ping pong after learning about DOM manipulation. Decided to get started on it without any assistance from the video that would follow, I created a simple score tracker. Some notes:

1. The score is submitted by using the number input in the middle of the screen (pressing enter) with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 10. 2. The buttons will not work until the Score has been set and stop working once the game is complete 3. The color of the scores change depending on who has won 4. The score submit does not work until the game has been reset

While I ran into a few snags here and there while coding it (I was stuck for around 10 minutes because I had a few things uppercase that should have been lowercase) I feel pretty proud of the small bit of refactoring I did via functions. Outside of the basics of how the system worked, anything could be done to reach the conclusion. I looked up a few things (I forgot about parstInt(), oops) and watched the instructor's version after I was satisfied with the finished product. I did not make any changes after watching the solution, so I left with some good knowledge (Using an object for the players to make the code less lengthy, using number variables and editing those instead of constantly pointing to a parseInt())
